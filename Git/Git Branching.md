## Branching in a Nutshell

### Create a New Branch

```git
git branch testing
```

This creates a new pointer at the same commit you are currently on:

![create_new_branch](../image/git_branching_create_branch.png)

Git use pointer `HEAD` to keep branch you're currently on.

You can easily see this by running a simple `git log` command that shows you where the branch pointers are pointing. This option is called `--decorate`:

```git
$ git log --oneline --decorate
f30ab (HEAD, master, testing) add feature #32 - ability to add new
34ac2 fixed bug #1328 - stack overflow under certain conditions
98ca9 initial commit of my project
```

### Switching Branches

To switch to an existing branch, use:

```git
git checkout [other-branch]
```

After run above command, HEAD will point to the `[other-branch]` branch.

> **Itâ€™s important to note that when you switch branches in Git, files in your working directory will change. If you switch to an older branch, your working directory will be reverted to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. If Git cannot do it cleanly, it will not let you switch at all.**

## Basic Branching and Merging

### Basic Branching

To create a branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run `git checkout` command with `-b` switch (let's say iss53 is the new branch you want to create and switch to):

```git
git checkout -b iss53
```

This code is shorthand for:

```git
git branch iss53
git checkout iss53
```

**This is an important point to remember: when you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.**

After creating a brach and you want to merge this brach to the branch `master`, you use:

```git
# Let switch to master branch
$ git checkout master

$ git merge [branch-you-want-to-merge]
# You maybe get something like:
Updating f42c576..3a0874c
Fast-forward
 index.html | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

After merging branch to `master`, you will delete branch:

```git
$ git branch -d [branch-you-want-to-delete]
Deleted branch [branch-you-want-to-delete] (...)
```
