## Distributed Workflows

> Unlike Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs), the distributed nature of Git allows you to be far more flexible in how developers collaborate on projects
>
> In centralized systems, every dev is a node working more or less equally on a central hub.
>
> In Git, every dev is potentially both a node and a hub.
